    <h2 id="pt1">Part 1: Solidify Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>HTTP</b>: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that
        is used by the World Wide Web (WWW) to request hypertext documents from
        one system to another. HTTPS is an encrypted form of HTTP and has become
        standard.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>URL</b>: A Universal Resource Locator (URL) is the network address of
        some resource
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>DNS</b>: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a service that takes a URL
        and returns the corresponding IP address either from a local lookup
        table or from a web DNS server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Query String</b>: The query string of a URL allows the browser to
        pass parameters to the backend server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Example: HTTP Verbs</b>: The two most common HTTP Verbs, or methods,
        are the GET and the POST methods. The GET method is used to request data
        from the backend server via the query string while the POST method is
        used to pass data to the backend server via the request body.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>HTTP Request</b>: An HTTP Request is a message sent to a server by a
        client requesting some action be taken. In the case of the GET method,
        the client is requesting the server return some information. For the
        POST method, the client is sending some information to the server for
        the server to process accordingly. The PUT and DELETE methods behave how
        one would expect: the PUT method updates or adds resources to the system
        and the DELETE method removes resources from the system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>HTTP Response</b>: An HTTP Response is a message sent from a server
        to a client in response to an HTTP Request. This message includes the
        status of the response, the response header, and any resources that were
        requested.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>HTTP Header</b>: The HTTP Header of an HTTP Message contains the
        metadata of the HTTP Message. This metadata contains things like
        authentication information, security information, compression
        information, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Browser URL Process</b>: the following things happen when a user
        types a URL into a browser:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The browser looks up the IP address from the hostname using the DNS
          </li>
          <li>
            The browser makes the appropriate HTTP request to that IP address
          </li>
          <li>
            The server processes the request and sends the appropriate response
          </li>
          <li>The browser creates and loads the DOM based on that response</li>
          <li>
            If the response requires resources from elsewhere, the browser makes
            the appropriate HTTP requests.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
